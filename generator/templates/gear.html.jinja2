        <h2>Bikes</h2>
        <p>
            The below table has been the original reason for this site and dates back to a time when there was no
            Garmin, Strava and all of that, but only non-smart tachometers. I used to look once per month on the
            odometer and write down its value which is also the reason for the database model (an absolute mileage value
            per month and then deriving all other metrics from that).
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes people ask me for recommendations: I like <a href="https://www.specialized.com">Specialized</a>
            bikes, they usually fit me quite well. I'm pretty agnostic to saddles as long as they are wide enough. I do
            prefer hard ones though and bib-pants with good cushions. Most bikes I own are equipped with a <a
                href="https://www.sq-lab.com/produkte/saettel/sqlab-sattel-612-ergowave.html">SQLab 612</a>.
            As much as everybody wants to be the next yellow jersey or wear the real polka dots, we probably can't, even
            though we might be able to buy the same gear as the pro-riders use. However, I'd rather invest into a
            mid-range frame instead, a good mechanical shifting solution and put the remaining money into a proper good
            wheel set. Why mechanical you might ask? Two reasons: All the latest stuff is completely wireless, and often
            kind of connected. I am afraid of a world in which those come with a subscription service. The other reason
            is more simple: The best mechanical solution is proved, and hardly much worse than the cheapest electronic.

            I guess I am not good at selling bikes and I prefer to keep them around these days.

        <h2>Shoes</h2>
        <p>
            I prefer <a href="https://www.saucony.com">Saucony</a> shoes, especially the Guide 14 for daily use. I
            bought a couple of them while they were still availble. The Guide 15 feels a tad bit better, but you get
            wet feet the moment the surface is just slightly wet.
            <br>
            I usually use a pair of "every day" trainers for a lifespan between 500 and 1000km. The Guide 14 has been
            proven to be on the upper end of that.

            I started running in September 2017 when it was still quite warm. I used normal sport shorts and functional
            t-shirts for that, nothing fancy. I do remember the first winter using quite some warm garment (actually, a
            jogger-suite normally predestined to be used in front of a TV) and even put on a woolen hat.
            <br>
            At least the latter changed a lot: Even in the winter months you'd usually find me running with just
            functional underwear and some running shirt. If it's below 10Â°C I'd usually use long tights and some light
            pullover. I hardly use anything for the head anymore. Depending on the pace and whether I had time for
            warm-up, shorts maybe fine, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            The faster you get, the fewer cloths you want to have on. It's easy as that. And for me personally, I prefer
            running with as few things with me as possible. Hard to believe, but I do leave the phone at home most of
            the time. I neither use running belts nor dedicated backpacks. On really hot days with long trainings I
            usually carry a simple bike-bidon with me.
