                Hi, my name is Michael, I'm a software engineer and when I don't sit professionally on my arse in front
                of a computer, you'll find me running, cycling or swimming somewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page used to be only about my cycling activities. These days I see myself as a proper
                friet-athlete, enjoying cycling, running, swimming and french fries, preferable the Dutch variant.
                Therefor, some statistics will include the overall numbers of mileages, altitude and duration, while
                others are restricted to cycling only.
            </p>
            {% for _summary in summary.itertuples() %}
            <p>
                While looking at cycling stats alone, I rode <strong>{{ _summary['total']|fmt_int }}km</strong> since
                <strong>{{ _summary['since']|fmt_date }}</strong> in total.
                That was an average of <strong>{{ _summary['avg_per_month']|fmt_int }}km</strong> per month.
                The worst month was <strong>{{ _summary['worst_month']|fmt_month }}</strong> with
                <strong>{{ _summary['worst_month_value']|fmt_int }}km</strong>, the best month was
                <strong>{{ _summary['best_month']|fmt_month }}</strong> with
                <strong>{{ _summary['best_month_value']|fmt_int }}km</strong>.
            </p>
            {% endfor %}
            <p>
                I track my mileage on bikes with this site, together with some integrations to my Garmin Archive
                (Checkout <a href="https://github.com/michael-simons/garmin-babel">Garmin Babel</a> if you are
                interested in that). I keep a local overview <a href="{{ url_for('mileage') }}">here</a> and I'll answer
                most follow-requests on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/michael-simons">Strava</a>. I'm
                somewhat proud of my progress since 2017 and created a dedicated <a
                    href="{{ url_for('achievements') }}">achievements</a> page in late 2023. The submenu on the gallery
                link will take you individual pages containing pictures I created while exploring my area and other
                beautiful places.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please have a look at the <a href="{{ url_for('history') }}">history</a> page if you are looking for the
                older versions of this site and the content that has been originally created for <a
                    href="https://leanpub.com/arc42byexample">arc42 by example</a>. The <a
                    href="https://github.com/michael-simons/biking2">Spring Boot</a> based version of this site ran from
                2014 until late 2023 until it has been ultimately replaced by a lightweight Python / DuckDB based
                version.
