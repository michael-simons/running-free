I am a [Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) user since 2011 or so.
Both for hobby projects and at work.
Spring is a unicorn project which just came of age and is legally allowed to drink alcohol in the USA: 21 years and still innovating.
In early 2014 I heard first of [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/) and I think it was love at first sight.
It had everything I liked from Ruby on Rails (or Groovy) and that in Java and Spring.

For me, that opened up a whole new world: My blog series [Developing a web application with Spring Boot, AngularJS and Java 8](https://info.michael-simons.eu/2014/02/20/developing-a-web-application-with-spring-boot-angularjs-and-java-8/) is one of the most read articles on my blog, it got featured several times in [This week in Spring](https://spring.io/blog/2014/04/15/this-week-in-spring-april-15-2014) and several other sides. 
It was really the right thing, at the right time, and it all came together: Java 8 (which was a tremendous edition with tons of new features), the way I designed the application as an API based on rest controllers and that I packaged an AngularJS frontend with it.

SQLite didn't fly well with Java back then, so I went over to [H2 Database Engine](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html), keeping the schema as is.
Yes, I am that person who ran H2 with persistent disk store in production for close to a decade.

The articles I wrote in 2014 and 2015, the feedback I got from the Spring Team, especially [Phil Webb](https://spring.io/team/philwebb) and [St√©phane Nicoll](https://spring.io/team/snicoll/) and the involvement in the early Pre-1.0 versions changed my trajectory and lead eventually to me writing a book about Spring Boot, the [Spring Boot Buch](http://springbootbuch.de), published in 2018. 
Through the work in the Spring ecosystem I also got into contact with [Oliver](https://spring.io/team/odrotbohm) and over him to [Michael Hunger](https://chaos.social/@mesirii).
That got me eventually to [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com), being a full-time maintainer of Spring Data Neo4j.

At the end of 2014 I had the great pleasure to meet [Gernot Starke](https://www.gernotstarke.de) and [Peter Hruschka](http://www.peterhruschka.eu) at a seminar and with some of the things described here, this changed trajectory again, in the mid-time but also in the long run.
I documented the whole Spring Boot page with [arc42](https://www.arc42.de) which ended up in a book named [arc42 by example](https://leanpub.com/arc42byexample) which sells till this very day.
The original sources of my piece are still in the [repo](https://github.com/michael-simons/biking2/tree/public/src/docs) and a rendered version of it is linked below if you can't afford the book.
