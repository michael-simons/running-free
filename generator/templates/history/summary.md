## Summary

- The database model stood the test of time and while I changed the actual database and the middleware for the 3rd time, it is quite constant.
- The development of great tools in the last decade is just stellar; I think the first Oracle version I used in early 2000 was less SQL compliant than DuckDB now.
- Standing on the shoulders of giants: Regardless whether it's Ruby, Java or Python. Of course, they are quite different languages, but apart query languages the ones I really like  best.
- Frameworks come and go, but something like Spring and Spring Boot is pretty unique.
- SQL just rocks.
- Doing the right thing at the right time, getting in contact with people: It's the best of doing things like this silly site in public.

Hat tip to all people explicitly mentioned here.
You're feedback always meant a lot to me, and you helped me along the way to where I am and what I know today.
