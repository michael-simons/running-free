# biking3

A collection of scripts, a database schema and a site-generator that creates https://biking.michael-simons.eu.
The repository is provided for educational purposes.
The whole software is catered for my needs and I doubt that is that useful for other people in production.
However, it takes an opionated approach in building a datacentric dashboard with including spatial data. 
As most of it is driven by SQL queries, the logic and algorithm being used are not hidden away behind some bulky front- or backendcode. 

## Database schema

The SQL commands have all been developed and tested with [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) >= 1.0.0.
They are separated in 3 categories:

- Base tables (Physical ER-Diagram is [here](generator/static/docs/schema.mermaid))
- Shared views (not particular helpful in isolation)
- API (Views to be accessed by all sort of clients)

## Site generator

The site generator is essentially a [Flask application](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) which can be run with a local development server.
The `app.py` entry-point can however be run with either `run` or `build` commands.
The latter will freeze the site and generate static HTML files.

## Tooling

The `bin` folder contains mostly shell scripts to interact with both the database and external services. 
The notable exception is `create_tiles.java`, a Java script runnable via JBang. 
It contains most of the logic to generate the explore tiles.
